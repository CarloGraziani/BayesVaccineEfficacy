The (very simple) python codelet vb.py is designed to perform a Bayesian analysis of vaccine efficacy from clinical trial data.

The analysis method is the one described in <a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.07.20244954v1>this preprint</a>. 

The code is the basis for all the efficacy plots displayed at the <a href=https://wordpress.cels.anl.gov/covid-vaccine-efficacy/>Vaccine Efficacy Page</a>. The data used to make the plots at that page is also available here, in the job control input file 'vb_in.py'. That input file is, incidentally, the best place to input clinical trial data of your own, should you feel disposed to do so.
